# **Projects**

Below is the list of the main projects that I am currently working on:

### **1. Personal Website**

This project consists of a site/blog hosted on Github Pages, with the goal of sharing posters that cover a wide range of topics related to the technology and development world. Each poster is carefully crafted to present clear and concise information about the subjects at hand. Furthermore, I hope to inspire the community through this project, promoting knowledge and awareness about relevant technology issues.
